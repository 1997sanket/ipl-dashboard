React 18 tutorial from CodeEvolution

1. React uses reusable Components to create Web apps.

2. It returns JSX which is JavaScript XML which is a syntactical sugar needed to make developer's 
    life easy by returning HTML like code. Internally it return "React.Component('div')"

3. In React 18, a component is nothing but a JavaScript function.
    - It accepts input properties and return HTML (JSX) which describes UI.

4. We can set attributes on our component tags, which we can use in the JS file using "props" object.
    And all the properties of this props object are immutable.

5. props vs state
    -props object is immutable and are controlled by parent component.
    -state is controlled by the component itself.

6. In case of Parent to Child component communication, we send 
    data in the Child attribute and collect it in the props.

7. In case of Child to Parent communication, Parent component
    will return child component and we send the method 
    reference to the child component attribute, and thus using
    props in the Child component we can use that method.

8. "Hooks" are special functions which hooks us up to React features.
